                <h3>The challenge</h3>
            </section>
            <section class="col-6">
                <p>Back in 2019 the were only three designers and the old website was split between different outsourced platforms. It was hard to maintain the delivery process, collect metrics and run AB-testing. So we started to build our own in-house platform and a design system to achieve desired business results. As a design team lead I established a proper design process including research and discovery. This approach helped the team get fast and impressive results across all business metrics and dramatically reduce delivery time and the amount of UX-defects.</p>

            <section class="col-6">
                <p>I started as a Senior Product Designer in one of the teams and my primary goal was to adjust the design process and perform a complete redesign of the website. Soon after our first results I become a Design Team Lead responsible for the whole team including the Platform team.</p>

                <p>The hardest part of the main page was the main slider. It contains up to 6 slides and the numbers said that the first slide was the most clickable (96%) and all other slides got 4% combined. We tested more than 10 different variant before finding the right one with tabs and the preview of each slide. This variant divided total clicks between all of the slides and increased CR of each featured product in the main slider.</p>

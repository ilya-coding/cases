            <section class="col-6">
                <p>After the redesign I decided to push things even further and make the whole process better including not only design but the whole delivery process. The big idea was to create a NoCode instrument and help our product and marketing teams to create pages faster.</p>

                <p>At this point I was promoted to the Design Team Lead and my new responsibility was to create a new team to drive the Platform yet still participating in design and discovery process.</p>

                <p>For the MVP we decided to use the Ant Framework so we could skip the frontend part and go straight into prototyping the solution and test it rapidly.</p>

            <section class="col-6">
                <p>The crusial part of the Platform is the internal services module and APIs such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Feedback module that allows us to collect direct feedback from all pages in one place</li>
                    <li>GEO for the proper ATM and offices maps with routes, amount of cash, working hours etc</li>
                    <li>File storage for better file management. Each file is stored in the database so any part of the website or any app could fetch it from one URL and get instant updates if needed</li>
                    <li>Short URL service</li>
                    <li>AB-test module that allows our teams to perform proper testing of their pages or any parts of it</li>
                    <li>Newsfeed and articles database for quick and easy publications within our website or any other platform via XML, JSON, RSS formats</li>
                    <li>Personalization that allows the interface to update itself based on user actions and other data. The basic example: if the user entered the website with a search link to some product page and went to the main page, the main page will feature this product more for this user during the session</li>

                <p>After validating the MVP I started to update the final design. At this stage I was responsible for the main components of the Platform such as file management module, feedback module, presets of common blocks, articles and FAQ database. Other parts were made by the team using established interface patterns.</p>

                <p>The best interface is the one that does not need a user manual :) Our new CMS is almost like that but there is a number of guides and docs that are used to implement new features or to reuse established patterns (including services and APIs).</p>

                <p>After the redesign we started to grow in numbers of product teams while our delivery process was not so scalable. Our stakeholders decided to add more designers into teams and my new task was to update the whole process of discovery and design so we could perform better across all teams.</p>

            <section class="col-6">
                <p>The first change I made was bringing designers closer to the process of discovery. Before that most of the decisions were made by Project Owners and Managers. I started by establishing regular sessions with our designers and stakeholders such as Demo-days where we shared our sprint results, ideas and experiments. These activities dramatically increased the value of the UX among the teams.</p>

            <section class="col-6">
                <p>The UX-research is the essential part of the design process. We adjusted our delivery process and implemented more user research methods so designers could use not only online analytics but participate more in offline sessions. To achieve that we rebuild our UX-laboratory and hired the team of skilled researchers for each business vertical.</p>

            <section class="col-6">
                <p>I established the 80/20 rule and split the total design time between immediate product design tasks and other activities that include the design-system, experiments, design-sprints and other workshops. This approach allows designers to see beyond their regular tasks, refactor legacy parts, grow in other fields. I facilitate many different activities such as workshops, design-sprints, retros, brainstorming sessions. Our stakeholders are the first ones to checkin for some action.</p>
